Welcome to the SA Online Mart Prototype Web Application. This application details a basic prototype for a hypothetical e-commerce store which sells locally made South African products on the behalf of 
smaller businesses.

Please note that this was made as part of an assignment for university. Any indications of sold products, required personal information, or required payments are not legitimate and 
will not be stored or used outside of this prototype.

To access this prototype, a log-in is required. Accounts may be created using the register page accessible via the log-in page, but to demonstrate the admin capabilities, the following data can be used to log in:
Email: addymin@gmail.com
Password: AddyMin@276

From the home page, products may be added to the cart. The same is true for the catalogue page.
The about page displays information on the website.
From the cart page, one may proceed to the checkout page, where delivery information is taken in. From there, one may proceed to the payment page, enter their information, and register the order.
From the admin page, one may add, edit, or remove products from the website's database.
